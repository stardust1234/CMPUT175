You have a total of 20 sonar devices and there are 3 treasure chests to find, randomly scattered in the ocean. 
The game ends when you do not have sonar devices left or you found all three chests. To find a chest you need 
to drop a sonar device at the exact x,y coordinates of the chest. In that case the sonar would indicate "X". 
The sonar devices are twice as sensitive on the column axis than the rows. It can detect a chest 9 units away
on both sides of the x axis and 5 units away on the y axis. If the sonar is dropped too far (more than 9 units 
away on the x axis and 6 on the y axis) from a chest, the sonar would indicate "O", meaning nothing detected. 
Again, the maximum range of the sonar device is 9 units on the x axis and 5 units on the y axis. If the sonar 
is less than 10 units away from a chest on the x axis, the sonar would indicate the distance (1, 2, ..., 9). 
Since the the sonar devices are twice as sensitive on the column axis than the rows, on the y axis (rows), if
 the sonar device is closer than 6 units, closer on the y than half the x axis, and still in the range, the sonar
 would indicate a for 1, b for 2, c for 3, d for 4 and e for 5 distance units.
